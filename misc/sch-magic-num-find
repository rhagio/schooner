NAME
       sch-magic-num-find - Search for instance of 5-digit magic-num in specified
	   directory. If found, place filespec and linenumber on stdout. Search is
	   non-recursive at present as that seems more convenient.

SYNOPSIS
       sch-magic-num [5-DIGIT-NUM] [DIRECTORY]

EXIT STATUS
       0      If file containing magic number found.
       1      If no such file found.
       stdout <magic-num><space><filespec> if file found, otherwise null

USAGE

EOF

DirSpec="$2";

[ "$MagicNum" != '' ] || { echo "missing argument(s)"; exit 1; }
[ "$DirSpec" != '' ] || { echo "missing argument(s)"; exit 1; }
Problem=$(sch-file-exists -s "$DirSpec" -rd)
[ "$?" = 0 ] || { echo "folder ($DirSpec) cannot be used - it is $Problem"; exit 1; }
# TODO: validate that MagicNum is indeed a 5-digit number
